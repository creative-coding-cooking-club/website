The Creative Coding Cooking Club is a bi-monthly in-person meetup in Hamburg that revolves around creative uses of technology, specifically programming.

You won't find neither lectures on the menu, nor is it a user group. Instead, we follow an easy recipe:

- 10 minutes to put some ingredients on the table
- 60 minutes for each person to get creative with the ingredients and stir it up
- 20 minutes of serve and taste

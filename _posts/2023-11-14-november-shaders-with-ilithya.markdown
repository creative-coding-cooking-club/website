Our last installment of the Creative Coding Cooking Club for 2023 happened on the 14th of November. We had a special guest: Digital artist Ilithya who gave us a crash course in shaders, short pieces of code that run natively on the graphics card. For each pixel on the screen in parallel! How cool is that!
